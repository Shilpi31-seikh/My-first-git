  <input type="radio" name="Q">Actually, it could be any of the above.  <br>

  <p>7. The electron microscope has been particularly useful in studying bacteria, because</p>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Electrons can penetrate tough bacterial cell walls  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Bacteria are so small.<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Bacteria move so quickly they are hard to photograph.<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">With few organelles present, bacteria are distinguished by differences in individual macromolecules.<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Their organelles are small and tightly packed together<br>
 
  <p> 8. Cell fractionation is the most appropriate procedure for preparing ____ for study</p>

  <input type="radio" name="Q">Cells without a functional cytoskeleton<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Isolated organelles<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">The basic macromolecules<br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Bone and other similar cells which are situated within a mineral framework<br>

  <p>9. Which of the following clues would tell you whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic?</p>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">The presence or absence of a rigid cell wall  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Whether or not the cell is partitioned by internal membranes  <br>

  <p>10. Sara would like to film the movement of chromosomes during cell division. Her best choice for a microscope would be a</p>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Light microscope, because of its resolving power  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Transmission electron microscope, because of its magnifying power.  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Scanning electron microscope, because the specimen is alive.  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Transmission electron microscope, because of its great resolving power.  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="Q">Light microscope, because the specimen is alive.  <br>
